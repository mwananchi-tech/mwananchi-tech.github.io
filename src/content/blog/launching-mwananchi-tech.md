Today marks the official launch of Mwananchi Tech, an initiative dedicated to making Kenyan parliamentary data accessible, understandable, and useful for every citizen.

## Why We Started

Kenya's Parliament generates thousands of pages of hansards, bills, and committee reports every year. This information belongs to the people, yet it remains largely inaccessible to the average citizen due to its volume and complexity.

## Our Approach

We're building open-source tools that leverage modern technology to transform this data:

- **AI-powered summaries** that distill lengthy sessions into key points
- **Searchable archives** that make historical records discoverable
- **Structured data exports** that enable researchers and journalists to do deeper analysis

## What's Next

We're just getting started. Our roadmap includes:

1. Expanding coverage to county assemblies
2. Building visualization tools for voting patterns
3. Creating alerts for topics citizens care about

Join us in building a more transparent Kenya.
